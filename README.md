# Python Testing with pytest — Exercises and Examples

Welcome to the repository dedicated to the book **"Python Testing with pytest"**! 📘

This repo contains all the exercises, examples, and additional notes as I progress through the chapters of the book. The goal is to reinforce concepts, practice testing strategies, and build a solid understanding of testing in Python with the `pytest` framework.

```

## 🛠️ Tools and Setup

To run the examples and exercises, make sure you have Python and `pytest` installed. You can set up the environment with:

```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If there’s no `requirements.txt`, you can manually install pytest:

```sh
pip install pytest
```

## 🚀 Running the Tests

Once the environment is set up, you can run the tests like this:

```sh
pytest
```

Or target a specific chapter or test file:

```sh
pytest ch3/test_example.py
```

## 📖 Purpose of the Repository

- **Practice:** Solve all exercises from the book.
- **Documentation:** Take notes and explain concepts learned.
- **Experimentation:** Try out extra test cases and edge scenarios.

This repository serves as a learning journal, and contributions or suggestions are always welcome! 🎯
